        Did you know:
        - You lose marks for using the word “closure” when proving something is a linear map?
        - You can do eigenvectors without back sub?
        - You can follow rules of thumb with picking between ratio test and the rest?
        - These seminars will boost your marks to an HD?<br />
        For a complete description, come chill at our term 2 revision seminar for MATH1231 and MATH1241!

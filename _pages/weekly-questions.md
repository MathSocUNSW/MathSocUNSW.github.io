Welcome to MathSoc's weekly questions competition, where we provide the puzzles and you provide the proofs. Every Sunday night we will be releasing two questions, one easy and one hard, and there will be points for the best submissions within the week.

We have prizes up for grabs for the mathematicians with the most points by the end of the term. For the hard question, there will be 3 points awarded for the best answer, 2 points for second best and 1 point for third. For the easy question, there are 2 points for the single best submission. <b>However</b>, an individual cannot submit an answer to both!

Prizes are determined by most number of points by the end of each 4 weeks. First place will receive $25 while second place gets $10, and everyone gets to practice their problem solving skills! Submissions are accepted by messaging either Abdellah (@porpoiise#2855) or Alex (@zhusuki#9544) on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Y7FFXxh">discord</a>, and submissions are not accepted after Saturday 5pm.

Good luck to everyone, and we looking forward to seeing your creative responses!

title_text: Here youâ€™ll find all of our written solutions/answers to some first year mathematics courses.

What we have written can separated into two components: Full Solutions, and Answers/Hints. Why the separation? We want to encourage students to being able to answer questions themselves, and not by blindly memorising solutions. We want you to understand the content, so we will only be uploading complete solutions to some, and answers/hints to others, and we expect you to work out the rest. Itâ€™s for your own good!

Note that these solutions are **NOT** endorsed by the UNSW School of Mathematics & Statistics, and that errors may exist.

If you find answers that are incorrect, please [send us a message]({{ site.url }}/contact/), and weâ€™ll try to address the question as soon as possible.

Good luck studying for your quizzes ðŸ™‚

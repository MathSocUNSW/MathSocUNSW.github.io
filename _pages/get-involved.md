title_text: 'To use an old cliché: MathSoc is a society by students, for students.'
---

Despite that phrase being used over and over, it is true. Every single person you see helping out volunteers their time and energy for the benefit of the society, and these dedicated volunteers help make MathSoc great! That said, if you'd like to assist us – we're always elated to add more enthusiastic and energetic people to the MathSoc team.

MathSoc is the society for mathematics students (obviously), but just because you don't study maths or statistics doesn't mean you can't be a part of one of the largest societies at UNSW!

We're open to all comers – and the only question you should ask yourself if you're pondering whether to join is: "Am I interested in maths?" Well, if you answered 'yes', then we're the society for you! (and yes, we assume that maths students would automatically be interested in maths).
There are four ways to get involved with us:

1. **Member**<br>
   As a member, you'll be able to take part in our exclusive events such as Pi Day, BBQs, networking events, sported related events and more. As a first year, you gain access to our solutions to past class tests designed to help you ace your quizzes! To join, click here.
2. **Subcommittee**<br>
   If you're looking to casually contribute to MathSoc, being a subcommittee member is probably right for you. Subcommittee members volunteer their time to work with our directors in either the Education, Events, IT, Marketing or Sponsorship portfolios in bringing fresh ideas to fruition.
   If you're someone enthusiastic about MathSoc, consider joining our subcommittee!
3. **Director**<br>
   Directors contribute greatly to the innovation of MathSoc, developing fresh ideas that directly impact on the growth of MathSoc.
4. **Executive**<br>
   These guys/gals are in charge of the high level direction of the society, and in ensuring things are on track! Positions include President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and Arc Delegate.

Essentially, MathSoc is made by volunteers – they're the lifeblood of the society. Without them, there is no MathSoc. So it stands to reason that we're always looking for helpers – so what are you waiting for? [Get involved!](/join/)

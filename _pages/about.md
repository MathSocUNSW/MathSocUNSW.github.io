UNSW Mathematics Society (MathSoc) is the society for mathematics students, however membership is open to anyone, and everyone, who has an interest in mathematics. Affiliated with Arc @ UNSW and with the School of Mathematics and Statistics – we are one of the largest societies at UNSW, boasting a member count over 3,000.

We have three main aims:
 - To enhance the sense of community amongst mathematics students
 - To inform students of the maths-related opportunities in their studies and careers
 - To support students in their studies and to provide a forum to discuss all aspects of mathematics

Our **social events** include the \'usual\', such as BBQs and trivia nights – but we also hold special events such as poker tournaments, social sports days and even our [annual integration bee]({{ site.url }}/events/integration-bee-champions)! All these are designed to help you network with other students, and build a community between you and others in a maths degree.

**Academic events** are also major on the MathSoc calendar. For the budding mathematics student, we offer talks and other events that assist in aiding your choice in what maths major to pick,

Along the same lines are our **Industry and Careers events** – which are a must for the older students. These help you discover potential jobs and careers that maths can lead you to – and also allow you to chat to people who can help you get there!

To round this off, we have a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1547055178894106/) where you can discuss maths to your heart’s content – which also doubles as a place to discuss anything and everything mathematical. Moreover, we have dedicated [First Year](https://www.facebook.com/groups/390697447649473/) and [Higher Year](https://www.facebook.com/groups/332194420189438/) Facebook groups – and for First Years, MathSoc also releases solutions to past class tests!

Essentially, MathSoc is here to help enrich the experience of studying maths at UNSW. We’re here to fulfill your social, academic and career needs – and help make your time at UNSW a great one!

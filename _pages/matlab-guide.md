**You:** *I want to learn a programming language.*

**Me, an intellectual:** *MATLAB.*

Hey friends, the slaves at MATHSOC have created an Interactive MATLAB guide, which can be accessed [here]({{site.url}}/assets/files/MATLAB_project.rar). It is meant to supplement the MATH1151/MATH1251 [online modules](https://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/MatlabSelfPaced/index.html), and contains 4 fun little projects to sink your teeth into. Note that it builds on, and does not replace, those modules which are excellent and comprehensive resources in itself. 

To access it, please export all given files into the same folder and double click on the one that says 'open this'.

Please do not hesistate to contact us if you have any questions, suggestions or spot any mistakes! ðŸ™‚

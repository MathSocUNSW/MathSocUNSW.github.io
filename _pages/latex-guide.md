Our Education Director in 2019, Rui Tong, compiled an Introduction to LaTeX guide to help many users start off with the software and commands. Although it is intended for introductory means, it was designed to provide as much of the basics as required for generic use as well.

Back in 2015, our then-Education director Brenden Trinh presented the first Introductory LaTeX seminar. This seminar covers most of the foundations with LaTeX, demonstrating how to get started and providing a basic view of a typical LaTeX document structure.

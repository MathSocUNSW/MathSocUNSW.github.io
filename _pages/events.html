        Welcome to the Puzzle Hunt of the year, jointly delivered by 🧩PuzzleSoc🧩 and 🔢MathSoc🔢‼️
        RATIONALISE your thinking 🤔 as you work through our x+1 = 6, solve for x number of puzzles. Be careful though, as some of these clues might be quite DISCRETE! No maths knowledge is required to solve these puzzles but the PuzzleSoc team will be available on the night to give hints!💡<br>
        Doesn't matter if you're competitive or casual- just get ready for an EXPONENTIAL 📈 amount of fun 🤩 Hope to see everyone there!<br>
        Format:
        <ul style="margin:0">
          <li>Teams of up to 4 members 👯‍♀️👯‍♀️</li>
          <li>At the start of the event we will release 4 puzzles which each team can solve at their own pace and in any order 📝</li>
          <li>Once the 4 puzzles are solved, we will release a 5th META puzzle to the team (the meta puzzle requires the answers of the previous 4 puzzles)</li>
          <li>The first team to solve all 4 puzzles + the meta wins! 🥇</li>
        </ul>
        Stay tuned as we are preparing some awesome prizes 🏆 which will be announced soon 👀

Want to end your O-Week on a maxima? Better yet, do you want to integrate before uni starts and make a couple more friends? Well, Mathsoc has an event right in your domain. 

MathSoc's Integration Bee is an annual competition where students of all skill levels and years, flex their integration skills on a number of brain-teasers for the coveted trophy. You can learn more about our past integration bees [here]({{ site.url }}/integration-bee-champions/)!

Even if you're maths-shy, don't fear we cater for all pizza lovers. Yep you read that right, we'll be having free pizza. **FREE PIZZA**! Can you really say no to free lunch? 

Better yet, we also have a couple of prizes valued up to $50 up for grabs.

Here's to integrating and chill ðŸ˜‰
